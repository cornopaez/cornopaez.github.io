Relational databases proved fascinating as well, and SQL a powerful tool to access the data. I'm currently learning about web development and working to learn about the Full Stack, to round my knowledge. I am familiar and feel comfortable in the languages below. Feel free to poke around the site and contact me if you have any questions."
