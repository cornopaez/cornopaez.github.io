        "Description": "I am a former musician who's discovered the joy of coding. I initially learned to code in Java, building small programs for my classes. Relational databases proved fascinating as well, and SQL a powerful tool to access the data. I'm currently learning about web development and working to learn about the Full Stack, to round my knowledge. I am familiar and feel comfortable in the languages below. Feel free to poke around the site and contact me if you have any questions.",
